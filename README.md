Sign on to a reasonable deal and then watch your monthly rent increase LIKE CRAZY. They are banking on the fact that you won't make the effort to move your stuff to another facility. Also, I signed up for auto-pay and naturally, the credit cards eventually expire. They are merciless about giving you a 25% late fee and wont budge on reversing the charge. Ridiculous, unethical & unscrupulous.

Roller coaster.... Good!!!!    In fact, amazing.

Location of said roller coaster... Even more fabulous.

Location of hotel... Not so good.  Especially when you've dressed nice with your lady pals and head on out to the strip.  3 hours later and 30 propositions from strange weirdos later, we finally made it to Caesars palace.  

Although I had a great time next time I'd book a place closer to wherever the action is (bellagio, Caesars palace).  The upside is it does have free parking below!!

PRO: staff was friendly.

CONS: Dog got sick from here.  Sneezing and difficulty breathing, which the dog has NEVER had.

At $50/day, I think they can do better with their strict warranty.

The pricing was not explained clearly and what we thought was $25/day turned out to be $50/day.

I have three dogs and three cats, and I am very particular about their care.  In 10 years living in Atlanta I never found a vet I was truly happy with.  

Upon moving to Charlotte, I am thrilled to have found Atrium Animal Clinic.  My pets have been seen by three of their vets, based on my pets' particular need and the doctors' specialties, and I have been very happy with all of them, both from their medical expertise and bedside manner/demeanor.  The entire staff is always pleasant and friendly to me and my pets.  I love that they offer both holistic and traditional options.  My preference is for a more holistic approach, but I like that the traditional options are available if needed.

I cannot imagine taking my pets anywhere else and am so grateful to have found this clinic.

Today I learned that not all Massage Envy's are created equal after having a not-so great experience at this location. The therapist stared the massage at 7:05 PM and ended it at 7:49PM, shorting me 6 minutes of time of my 50 minutes of time, which is very frustrating when you're paying for a set amount of massage time. I arrived 15 minutes early so I know I wasn't shorted due to any mistake of my own. The therapist also never asked me how the pressure was (it was very light considering I requested firm to deep) which I found very odd since every other massage therapist I've ever had has asked this question at least once, if not multiple times. It wasn't the worst massage I've ever received, it's just disappointing to to feel like you didn't get the full value of what you paid for.

We looked all over the place and still didn't see anything that looked like a pizza place.  We finally had to ask, and I still didn't believe it until I turned the corner and saw the pizza ovens.  

The long dark hall, framed on either side with old album covers was a bit nostalgic,  I could see a video game, one of those older arcade types, and a flat screen, but once inside and around the corner, a mall counter and several large pizza's laid before use  to choose our slice, pepperoni with meatball. 

It was reheated and not bad, it actually retained a good crust, not soggy at all.  We must have been there at just the right time because there wasn't a line, and only three other people around.  I had read there could be a long line and wait A definite must try kind of place.

I am picky and I'm also not one who is going to go ooooo & aaaaaah over a lot of things.  That being said, in Phoenix, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting an apartment complex.  Andante Apartments has everything pretty much that every other complex has and that being said, I focused on what it didn't have instead to sway decision of living.   I don't smell marijuana in the air when I'm walking my dog at night.  I don't hear people in the parking lot at 4:00 am yelling.  I don't see children running amok or leaving toys outside.  In addition this complex houses a great number of Intel employees and young up-and-coming professionals who are not about partying all night being a nuisance the neighbors.  Do you get it like these people do? They go to work, do their their jobs and come home to a place that they can pridefully say they call home.   Yes I live here,  No I'm not employed by this company but hey, come live with us.   The cost is just right & leaves you with not only some extra money to spend but to save as well.

The pizzas we ordered were okay (not the best but not the worst either), but the wait to get our food was over an hour due to a large party inside, and staff wasn't very attentive to our table during this hour. Some other tables that ordered after us got their meals first. However, due to the long wait, they brought us a slice tiramisu, which we enjoyed. The tiramisu was delicious!

I had a chance to walk around this casino, the interior is beautifully designed and the air inside is very clean. A waitress came to take our drink orders as soon as we sat down at the tables, and the drinks were not watered down. Its a long walk from other popular casinos like bellagio, aria and caesars.
